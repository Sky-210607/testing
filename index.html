And then when I again saw you wearing a Saree, of one of my favourite colours, I swear I could feel butterflies in my stomach, my heart literally beating like a drum and fireworks in my mind.I love this picture cause we look so kyoot.

            <p>Of course its one of the BEST DAYS I've lived cause I WENT OUT ON A MOVIE DATE WITH YOU. The first half of the movie, yes I was focused also panicking cause I AM WATCHING A SPIDER MAN MOVIE WITH THE LOVE OF MY LIFE! Of course you saw me texting my friends about it in the interval. But after the interval..? OH MY FREAKING LORD. THE WAY WE WERE SITTING. THE EYE CONTACT. EVERYTHING. Then we were just eating in silence cause we both were hungry lmao but damn that day was. Max e teen baar ghora and CC2 er balcony te bosha, shiri te bosha eventually guard e bhagiye dilo, very similar to the Louvre scene of heartstopper. Our outfits were slay.</p>

Makes me cry everytime I think about this day. This picture is my absolute favourite, the dream of going to pride with my partner came true. To get embraced by my partner in that crowd.</p>

            <p>1st feb, one year ago this day from getting overwhelmed after seeing art supplies in the streets of college street to discovering unknown streets and roads, we actually were exploring Kolkata. And then we went to our favourite place to relax and enjoy the subtle intimacy (i still dont know how we were so courageous to kiss there). Everything was just awesome that day but my most favourite part of the day was us cuddling and eating ice cream and of course the gift exchange. :3 Our messy hair and tired faces say it all that how much fun we had that day! </p>

            <p>Our second Saraswati Pujo! The place was so beautiful. We didn't go inside because we were too involved in doing something else, which a man across the building witnessed. Even though we didn't get anything to eat, it was worth it. We will go again, okie? We both wore sarees and you made me wear brown lipstick. Since then, I've only worn brown lipstick because yes. We look fantastically gorgeous in the pictures. My wife right there! AAAAAAAA :3</p>

            <h2>Christmas 2023</h2>
            <p>As I told you earlier, Christmas is one of my favorites. Celebrating it with you made my inner child very happy. I was so excited to go out with you that I was literally dancing, singing, and jumping around. When we met, my heart skipped a beat when I saw you. The Spiderman bouquet you gave me is so precious. Going to CC2 felt much better because it was finally just us. The guy who saw us kissing was so hilarious, lol. We got married, hehe :3</p>

            <h2>Chhaad</h2>
            <p>One of my favorite places to be with you? Chhaad, yes. That Chhaad witnessed our whole story, from March 20th, everything. Despite the annoying family, it was the place I always loved to escape to. Being in your arms, laughing with you, or just sitting in silence made me feel safe as if everything around was silenced. Wednesdays were my favorite because I got to spend a little more time with you. I used to skip classes because my syllabus was complete, so why not?</p>

            <h2>20th March</h2>
            <p>Thought I forgot to add this memory, huh? Sike. I can never forget any day spent with you. It was our very first date. I was extremely nervous to meet your family. We were so shy that we sat far away from each other while watching the movie. The little fight we had when you wanted to put ketchup on my nose – oh my god. How I wished time would stop on your chhaad. It felt so good to be in your embrace. That was the moment I was convinced that you are the person I want to be with for the rest of my life.</p>
